# netflix-shadow
This is my first project built in Node.js connected to MongoDB. It is a clone of the netflix login page where the user's details vis a vis e-mail and password are stored in the database 
without any encryption.
So basically it's just a login form with the design of Netflix.
For front-end HTML, CSS and Javascript have been used.
Back-end is build using Node.js and Express.js
Database is built using Mongoose.
